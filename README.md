# 0214-Baltimore-vs.-Philadelphia-Commuting-Zones-and-Income_Sanny-YE

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

When looking at the Distribution of Individual Income in Baltimore, the well-known “butterfly” shape is shown in red, which indicates that individual income of people in those neighborhoods are below average. However, when looking at the percentage of people who still stay in the same commuting zone as they were in their childhood, we see the “butterfly” covered in green - an indication of a rather large proportion of people choosing to stay in the same neighborhood for decades. As we see a similar reversing trend in Philadelphia as well, I started wondering if there’s direct correlation between these two factors.

Examination of the correlation coefficients show that a negative relationship exists between individual income of people living in different neighborhoods and the percentage of people who stay in the same commuting zone as adults in both Philadelphia and Baltimore. The more extreme nature of Baltimore’s datasets - lower in average income and higher in percentage staying - results in an even stronger correlation between the two factors.

In an article titled “Same City, Different Opportunities,” the author Cecilia Reyes states that kids from low-income families are not very likely to have opportunities to move to a better neighborhood, which means that they lack a chance to receive better education and to be immersed in a better environment in general. “When we say that a neighborhood has failed its children, … the underlying actors there are the political and the social institutions themselves,” Reyes concluded. There’s still a long way to go to achieve equal opportunities.
